# Properties
-  The project consists of four main pages:
    Home : If there are already created notes on the homepage, there is an option to search by title and by tag for easy access to these notes. You can also click on the notes to go to the detail page or 
    create a new note.
    
   New Page: After clicking the create button on the homepage, you can add notes on the new page. The new page has a title, tags, and content section.  After filling in the title, tags and content fields, 
   you can press the save button and save your new note, or you can press the cancel button and go to the previous page
  
    Detail Page: On the detail page, you can see the tags and descriptions you have written for the notes you create. There are three buttons on the detail page, edit, delete, and back: you can use these 
    buttons to delete the note, go to the previous page, and edit the note you already created.

   Edit Page: On the edit page, you can add new tags, descriptions and change the title to the notes you have already created.
